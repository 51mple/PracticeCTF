If we try to register, we are brought to a page that tells us that our user hasn't been saved to the database.
We also find a comment that tell us that /source.zip contains the source code of the website.

Unzipping the archive, we see 3 files: class.php, create.php, and index.php.
In class.php, we find a class called "ReadFlag", and in index.php, we see that a php object is being deserialized from a cookie.

This is known as PHP Object Injection, where we can inject arbitrary objects into a php script.
Running serialize.php, we get back the serialized version of the ReadFlag object we want.

Viewing the web page with our cookie set to that string, we can see the flag:

{0bj3cT_injection_mcuh_fun}
