We want to set someone's vote count to 111, but we can't just click our way to victory.
Looking at the source code, this line seems like the place to exploit.

    $query = "UPDATE noescvotes SET `$who`=`$who`+1 WHERE id=1";

The code also filters out single quotes, but backticks are being used in the query.
We can set bill's vote count by doing this:

    bill` = 111

However, there is an error within the syntax, and by looking at the error, we know that
we need to add another candidate.

Final payload is: bill`= 111,`george`= `george
