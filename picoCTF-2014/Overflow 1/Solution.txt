Looking at the source shows that we need to overflow the buf buffer, which is 16 characters long.
If we spam it with 16 A's, we can now write to secret. It's asking us if secret is 'c0deface', then
it will give us the perms needed to view flag.txt.
Flowing in \xce\xfa\xde\xc0 after the A's will give us the shell.
The complete overflow is AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\xce\xfa\xde\xc0
