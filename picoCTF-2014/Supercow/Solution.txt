The program reads any file that has the .cow extension. However, the flag is a
txt, so we need to somehow turn it into a .cow. The hint tells us to look up
symbolic links, so we know that we need to link a .cow file to the flag.
With the following commands, we can link a .cow file and the flag, and get said flag

    ln -s /home/daedalus/flag.txt flag.cow
    /home/daedalus/supercow flag.cow
