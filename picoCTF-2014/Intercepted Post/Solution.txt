Opening up the wireshark file in wireshark or cloudshark reveals a bunch of packets.
The hint tells us that a login is done through a POST request, so if we filter all the packets
by the string 'POST', we narrow down our search greatly. Then, we notice that there login request, and if
we follow the stream, we find the username and password. The password is url encoded, so if we decode it,
we get the flag.
