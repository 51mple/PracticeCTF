Looking at the source code shows that we need the value of secret to be '1337beef'.
However, we don't know the address of secret just yet, so we can't write to it.
We can open up the gdb and get the address of secret by doing

    gdb write_right
    print &secret

Now we know the address of secret, so if we run write_right, we can tell it to write
'1337beef' to 0x804a03c, which will give us the flag.
