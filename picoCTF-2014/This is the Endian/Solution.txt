If we look at the code, we can tell that we need answer[0] to be 0x52657663
and answer[1] to be 0x30646521. If we decode these two from hex to ascii, we figure out
that our input needs to be 'Revc0de!' in some other order. The website also tells us that
little endian is being used, which reverses the input onto the memory. The hint tells us that
an integer is 4 bytes, or 4 characters, which means that we need to reverse 'Revc0de!' in groups of 4.
If we reverse it, we get 'vceR!ed0', which is the correct answer.
