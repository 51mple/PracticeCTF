This is basic ASM, and it really is basic.
What we want to find is the value of %eax by the time the program ends.
It may look absolutely confusing, but it isn't so bad.
Translated to python, the program looks like this:

ebx = 533
eax = 8842
ecx = 16131
if ebx < eax:
    ebx = eax * ebx
    ebx = eax + ebx
    eax = ebx
    eax = eax - ecx
else:
    ebx = eax * ebx
    ebx = eax - ebx
    eax = ebx
    eax = ecx + eax

print eax

Running this in python will give you the flag.
