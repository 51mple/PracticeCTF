This problem was a little bit long, only because there was so much information to keep track of.

In order to solve the problem, you need to first acquire the admin account on PlanetBid, which
can be done by logging in with the credentials admin:asdfg. At the top, it tells us that admin activity is logged,
which is suspicious, so we then clear the logs to hide our tracks. Now, as admin, we can view bids and all the members.

We don't know exactly what the our client sold, but we do know by looking at members.db that he has an id of 31.
If we look at the bids.db, we get to see that only one bid took place where a user with id of 31 was involved as
the seller, and that is a RARE Dr. Pepper for 1.32 euros. We also now know the id of the buyer, a user with an id of
11. Consulting the members database, we find that this person's username is nemisis and their email is jelliot@mail.com.
However, this isn't all that we can find out, because looking at the url:

    https://www.hackthis.co.uk/levels/extras/real/4/planetbid/view.php?members&1=user&2=email

we notice that columns are displaying data based on the values of &1 and &2. Changing &2 to pass gives
us the password of all the users. Nemisis's account password is 742929dcb631403d7c1c1efad2ca2700, which
is the md5 hash of chicken. Knowing all of this, we can now connect to his email with the credentials
jelliot@mail.com and chicken.

Now that we have access to his email, we can request his SafeTransfer account password with the username nemisis and
email jelliot@mail.com.
It turns out that his SafeTransfer account password is i.am.awesome, so we can now log into his SafeTransfer account.

To complete the level, you need to transfer 1.32 (euros) to the account 64957746. Any more or less will fail the level.
Also, it is important that you clear the admin logs on PlanetBid or else the level will fail as well.
