If we select one of the links, we can see that in the url, there is a parameter where the page
is being passed into. If we change p to a page that doesn't exist, like oijaisofjoij, then we get an
error stating:

    Warning: file_get_contents(oijaisofjoij.html) [function.file-get-contents]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in pages on line 22

We would like to be able to load up admin.php, but we can't since it's adding .html to the end of the string.
However, using null bytes, (%00), we can ignore the .html and load up admin.php, but it isn't in the current directory.
Going back a directory works and the page is loaded up successfully.

Looking at the source code, there is a comment containing the actual password, so going to the real admin page, we
can enter the password and pass the level.
