Looking at the code, it seems pretty difficult to reverse the hash, but we can notice that at the top, there
is a comment telling us what kind of login system was implemented.

The link is dead (probably too old), but looking it up on the internet reveals a very interesting post by some guy over at
http://www.codingforums.com/javascript-programming/4939-hellp-savascript-login.html
He has a question, which we don't really care about, but he attatches the files used for login.
Inside, there are a few files, most importantly members.js, which has the usernames and passwords stored in plaintext.

Over on the server that we need to break into, we can view the members by simply going to the members.js file.

    m[m.length]=new Array("Admin","password","Home","/levels/real/3?pw=password");
    m[m.length]=new Array("John T","sheeprule","Home2","/levels/real/3?pw=newsheep");
    m[m.length]=new Array("Temp","password","Loloips","http://www.google.com");

The first login didn't work, but the second one did.

Username: John T
Password: sheelrule
