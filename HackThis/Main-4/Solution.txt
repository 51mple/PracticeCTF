Looking at the source, near the section with the form, there is a hidden input that seems to store the location
of a secret file.

<input type="hidden" name="passwordfile" value="../../extras/ssap.xml">

If we go to https://www.hackthis.co.uk/levels/extras/ssap.xml, which is the path to this file, we can find the
credentials right there on the page.

Username: 999
Password: 911
