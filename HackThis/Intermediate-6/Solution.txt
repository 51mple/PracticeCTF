This login screen is trying something a bit different and is not using SQL. Try and login as the user whose real name is 'Sandra Murphy'.

We need to login as someone whose real name is 'Sandra Murphy', so let's try
'or realname='Sandra Murphy'

Hmm. The server seemed to reject my query. But, the login screen is NOT using SQL, so playing around some more
reveals that we should use another 'or' condition and that it should not end with a ', bringing the
payload to look something like

'or realname='Sandra Murphy' or '1'='1
