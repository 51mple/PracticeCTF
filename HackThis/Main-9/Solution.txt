Inputting our own address into the credentials requester does not seem to work.
Looking at the source, there appears to be a hidden input with the admin's email. Trying that does not yield the credentials either.
We would like to send the credentials to our own email, but we can't. Now, we can assume that the email that we submit
is being checked against the hidden email, so if we change that email to our own, we pass the level.
