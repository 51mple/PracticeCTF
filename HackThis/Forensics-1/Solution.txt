We can use PhotoRec to recover the files from the disk image, and rarcrack to crack the password
of the rars. Inside one of the rars is a .wav file, which we can extract tones from with
http://www.dialabc.com/sound/detect/index.html, where we get these tones:

    AA6BA4A83C67DDC7

Noticing the format of the mission codes within one of the txt files, we can format the password to be correct.
Password: AA6B-A4A8-3C67-DDC7
