What's important to note is this javascript function:

function loadimage()
{
    var username= document.getElementById('username').value;
    var password= document.getElementById('password').value;
    URL= "members/" + username + " " + password + ".htm";
    path = URL;
    document.getElementById("status").innerHTML = 'Checking details...';

    req = getreq();
    req.onreadystatechange = exists;
    req.open("get", path, true);
    req.send(null);
}

What this effectively does is check if the page at members/usernamepassword.htm exists, and if it does, then we get redirected to the main page.
Since the username+password.htm is going to be a page, we can look at the members directory via https://www.hackthis.co.uk/levels/extras/real/2/members.
This lists a bunch of pages, which are usernames and passwords. Looking at one of them, we can find the username and passwords for librarian.

Username: librarian
Password: sweetlittlebooks
