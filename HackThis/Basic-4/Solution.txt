Using a nice tool called exif, we were able to view the metadata of the jpg. For the user, all
we needed to do was find the name of the artist, which happened to be james.
For the password, we could see that there was a comment, saying 'I like chocolate'.
Knowing this, we can infer that the password is chocolate.

Username: james
Password: chocolate
