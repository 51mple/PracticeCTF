Unzipping the archive, we find inside a bunch of flags from different countries, and a Thumbs.db file.

We can extract the Thumbs.db file by running:
$ 7z x Thumbs.db

Looking at the headers of the all the files extracted, we find that there are 24 bytes of useless
junk before the actual first byte of the image. We can get rid of all by running:

$ for file in *; do xxd -s24 -p "$file" | xxd -r -p > "$file.jpg"; done

One of the images is actually a QR code, so we can scan it by running:
$ zbarimg *.jpg
