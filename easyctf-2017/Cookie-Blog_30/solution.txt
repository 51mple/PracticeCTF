Upon visiting the website, we are greeted with a simple website without much information.
However, the name of the problem suggests that we are dealing with cookies, and if we look at
our cookies on the page, we find the url-encoded version of the flag:
easyctf%7Byum_c00kies%21%21%21%7D

Decoding that will give us the actual flag:
easyctf{yum_c00kies!!!}
