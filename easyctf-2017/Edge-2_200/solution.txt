Just like the last problem, the website uses git, but this time /.git forbidden.
However, the actual files are still available to be downloaded, so as long as we
know what we're looking for, we can reconstruct the repository.
This can be proved by visiting http://edge2.web.easyctf.com/.git/index,

We can download the basic files that all git repositories have to get a basic idea of what the repository looks like.
See git_init.sh

However, we need more information to actually reconstruct the repository.

In order to actually retrieve the files and blobs, you need to know a little bit about how git stores them.
Git stores objects within the objects folder, and assigns a folder name and file based on the object's hash. For example, if the hash of a blob was
aa3025bdb15120ad0a2558246402119ce11f4e2e, the object would be located at .git/objects/aa/3025bdb15120ad0a2558246402119ce11f4e2e.
Knowing this, we simply need to find the hashes of the various files. We can do so via the command "git fsck"
This command verifies the objects in the work tree, but we don't have any objects within our objects folder, so it'll tell us what is missing.
Using get_object.sh, we can grab the object based on its hash from the server. Simply grab whatever git fsck
says is missing. Eventually, enough objects will be restored for the log to become viewable

$ git diff HEAD~2
