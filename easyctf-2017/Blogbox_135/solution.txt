Poking around the website, there doesn't seem to be anything suspicious, and the search query
doesn't seem vulnerable to SQL injection. The key to solving the problem is noticing that
the hint says

    Use the search bar to see all the public posts! (And only the public posts!)

Looking at the format of the url when submitting a search, we see that it uses a GET parameter to
retrieve the search query. Since by default we're only allowed to see the public posts, we can try
setting the parameter "public" to false to see the private posts.

We can confirm our suspicions by searching for "flag" with and without the public parameter and noticing that
private query doesn't return any results. Now, we only need to find the search query that will give us the flag.

The flag can be found at http://blogbox.web.easyctf.com/search?query=easyctf&public=false

I was searching around for stuff today! I found this super cool string. Whatcha think? easyctf{i_cant_GET_n0_s@tisfAct10N}
