The server seems to limit users to queries less than or equal to 11 characters in length.

The hint asks us how we can eval in as few characters as possible, and luckily for us, PHP has a
execution operator (`) that will allow us to execute commands.

Inputting "echo `ls`" tells us that there is a flag file that needs to be read, but the file name is too long
We can get around this by viewing all the files in the directory using wildcard expansion.

The final payload is:
echo`cat *`
