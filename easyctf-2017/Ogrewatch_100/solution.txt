Running `file` on the given file tells us that it is an mkv, a video format.

$ mkvinfo ogrewatch

The mkv comes with subtitles, which we can extract by running `mkvextract`. The second
set of subtitles, which are in English, look the most interesting, so let's try extracting those.

$ mkvextract tracks ogreman_repaired 2:subtitles.txt

Opening subtitles.txt, we find the flag:
easyctf{subs_r_b3tt3r_th@n_dub5}
