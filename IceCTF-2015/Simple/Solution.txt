The server asks us to add a number to the ascii value of ";" that would give the ascii value of "i".
The difference between the two characters is 46, but the server only accepts values greater than 100.
Playing around with some numbers shows that the values wrap around, so we just need to find the value at which the number
wraps around, and add 46 to it.
Inputting 256 gives us back ";", so adding 46 to that would give us 302, which is the correct input.

The flag is very_simple_right
