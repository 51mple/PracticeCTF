This problem was similar to another problem I did for pico, and I guessed that the flag file would
be one level below all the other gifs. The url I went to was http://web2015.icec.tf/giffy/gif.php?gif=../flag.txt
but it didn't show me anything. Running it through curl however, revealed the flag.

The flag is flag_donald_62Ia6KTXSVviM
