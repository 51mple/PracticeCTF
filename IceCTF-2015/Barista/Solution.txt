This problem is also very similar to another ctf problem, namely Hack.lu's Objection problem.
We need to change the value of is_admin to true, and we can do this via defineGetter.
Going to this url gives us the flag.
http://coffee.icec.tf/__defineGetter__?args=is_admin

The flag is flag_i_dont_even_like_coffee_but_i_love_coffeescript
