Running `strings` on the file, we find several suspicious plaintext strings:

...
Password is Advicemallard
Password is Butter
Password is Hoobastank
Password is Darth
Password is Jedimaster
Password is Masternamer
Password is Morpheus
Password is Neutron
Password is Coyote
Password is Tweety
...

Trying each of the strings as the password, we find that the correct one is "Masternamer"

$ ./binaary50 Masternamer
3cd50c6be9bbede06e51741928d88b7e

Take the sha256 hash of that string to get the flag:

$ python
>>> import hashlib
>>> hashlib.sha256("3cd50c6be9bbede06e51741928d88b7e").hexdigest()
dad827e94c609b76424287f2523b2117475df29e4ca8475444a9976faedc00f7
